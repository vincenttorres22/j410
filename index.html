    <div class="text"> The Cal Poly Drag Club hosts its bi-monthly paint night in downtown SLO. Paint nights offer opportunities for members to bond and seek advice/help with anything from sewing outfits all the way to styling wigs and doing makeup. Club president Lewis Goodman, also known as Nova Caine, a fifth year industrial engineering major commented on the purpose of paint nights, saying that they mainly serve to “foster an environment of sisterhood, fun  and acceptance while teaching newer queens the basics of drag.”

Jessica has been a stage manager for the drag club for two years and hosts a lot of the paint nights at her house downtown.</div>

    <div class="text">Alison O’Neill, known in the drag community as Chief Queef stares into the camera with their signature makeup look. “Doing drag allows me to express some of what life is like with autism, mental illness, and being trans. It is more than just a little cathartic. Being able to turn something that is making my life a living hell into something constructive, artistic and maybe even good is eye opening to me” says O’Neill.</div>

    <div class="text">A quick swipe of a liquid lipstick transforms the lips color completely and ties the whole look together, reminding us all what drag is truly about. “Drag is not about competition, or about winning” says Goodman “it’s about doing what you love and changing the world with your art. Anyone can wear lipstick, but it's what you do while you’re wearing the lipstick that truly matters.”
